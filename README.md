  <p>Hi everyone! Today, I've been a little sick with bacterial infection, and a little coughs. Other than that, I'm fine! I am going to a chemistry lecture tomorrow, which will be a little boring, but fun. I'll try to write an update tomorrow, but I'll come home pretty late, so it might not be there. I feel bad that I didn't follow through with my performance at my school's winter arts festival, but other that that, I'm pretty happy. Hope everyone has a good day! Bye :D</p>

  <p>Hai guys! Oh wow... The chemistry lecture was soooooo boring. When I finished it I wanted to shout xD. All we discussed was the history of atoms, development of the atomic theory, and electron configuration. Actually, the last part wasn't that bad. The thing is, this is the third time I'm taking chemistry outside of class, and I've done this like 10 times each. I guess to me that's why it was boring. It also seemed like the speaker was reading from a script. Lemme tell ya why: He said "As you've all learned from high school...", but 2/3 of us aren't even in high school yet! (not me, I'm in high school) His tone was also really close to monotone as well. Oh well. That felt so much better. Anyways, hope you guys had an awesome day! If you wanna play in Minecraft or some video game, message me in my email, twitter, or discord. See ya!</p>

  <p>Hello random person. I see you've stumbled across my blog. No matter how you did it, I just want to tell you thanks for taking the time to read this. I also want to tell you that <b><i>you</i></b> are special. You have done something others couldn't. What you have done, is be you. You have done it longer than anyone else, and can do it longer. You are you, and you are special. Have a great day!</p>
